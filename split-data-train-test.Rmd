## Splitting data to training & testing


```{r}

# load library
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)

```

```{r}

# load data set
data("loan50") |> as_tibble()

loan50 %>% head()

loan50 %>% colnames()

```

```{r}
# split data into training & testing
loan50 <- loan50 |> mutate(row_id = row_number())

# add row_id to original data set
# pull 70 % of data & pull to training
training_df <- loan50 |> sample_frac(0.70)

# pull 30 % (the rest) to testing & remove row_id
testing_df <- loan50 |> 
  anti_join(training_df, by = "row_id") |> 
  select(-row_id)

# remove row_id
training_df <- training_df  |> select(-row_id)

```
