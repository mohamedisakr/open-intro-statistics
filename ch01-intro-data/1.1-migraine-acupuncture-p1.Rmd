## (a) What percent of patients in the treatment group were pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture?
```{r}
# install openintro package
# install.packages("openintro") # already installed

# load library
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)

# load migraine data set
data(migraine)

migraine %>% head()

migraine %>% distinct(group)

# percent of patients group (treatment - control) - pain free
patients_group_by_pain_percent <- migraine %>% 
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = (round(count / sum(count), 2) * 100)) %>% 
  arrange((percent))

patients_group_by_pain_percent

# aggregating


```


## (b) What percent were pain free in the control group?

## (c) In which group did a higher percent of patients become pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture?

## (d) Your findings so far might suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines for all people who suffer from migraines. However this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients that are pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture in the two groups?

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
