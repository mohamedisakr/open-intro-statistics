## GUIDED PRACTICE 1.7


```{r}

# load library
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)

```

```{r}

# load loan data set
data("loan50")

loan50 %>% head()

loan50 %>% colnames()

```

Examine the variables in the loan50 data set, which are described in Figure 1.4 on page 12. Create
two questions about possible relationships between variables in loan50 that are of interest to you.


```{r }
# 2 example questions: 
# (1) What is the relationship between loan amount and total income? 
ggplot(data = loan50, aes(x = total_income, y=loan_amount)) + geom_point(size = 2)


# (2) If someoneâ€™s income is above the average, will their interest rate tend to be above or below the average?

avg_income = mean(loan50$total_income)
avg_income

avg_interest_rate = mean(loan50$interest_rate)
avg_interest_rate

above_avg_income <- loan50 %>% 
  filter(loan50$total_income > mean(loan50$total_income)) %>%
  mutate(interest_rate_trend = ifelse(interest_rate > mean(interest_rate), "above", "below")) %>%
  select(total_income, interest_rate_trend) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_income))

above_avg_income

```
